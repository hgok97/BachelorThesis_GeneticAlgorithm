'''
solving the CVRP for Garabage Collection
with a genetic algorithm.

TODO: Create a very basic/simple/naive GA to solve the Problem
TODO: Generate a Dataset to Test Performance
TODO: Research different ways crossover/mutation operators, representations in order to get a better solution
TODO: Compare different operators and note any differences for the discussion part
TODO: also build in some visualization for the route optimization
TODO: incorporate the garbage collection problem into this... maybe include realword constraints?
